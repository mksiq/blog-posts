I am currently working, so I had only about a couple of hours daily free to work on this project.

I tried to keep caching simple by using what Spring Boot offers by default. For multi-threading I used CompletableFutures. However, also for simplicity I did not take into account max numbers of threads, and could be improved.
For testing, it is only covering unit test.
Documentation is provided by SpringDocs/Swagger.

Overall, this was a fun project that I enjoyed spending my time on, so thank you.
